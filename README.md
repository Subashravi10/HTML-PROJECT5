# HTML Project Tutorial - Event Page, Tables, and Forms

Welcome to the HTML Project Tutorial repository! This repository contains the starter and final code for two complete projects that will be covered in a YouTube tutorial series. The tutorial series aims to provide comprehensive knowledge about HTML and guide you through building two exciting projects: an Event Page and a project focused on Tables and Forms.

## Project 1: Event Page

In the first project, we will build an Event Page that will cover a wide range of fundamental HTML components. Throughout this project, you will learn how to use the following HTML elements:

- Heading Tags: `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`
- Paragraph Tags: `<p>`
- Anchor Tags: `<a>`
- Body Tag: `<body>`
- HTML Boilerplate: `<html>`
- Image Tag: `<img>`

By the end of this project, you will have a clear understanding of how to structure basic HTML elements and create an appealing Event Page.

## Project 2: Tables and Forms

In the second project, we will dive deeper into HTML by focusing on two important components: Tables and Forms. Tables are used to present data in a structured format, while forms are essential for user input and data submission. Throughout this project, you will learn to use the following HTML elements:

- Table Tag: `<table>`
- Table Row Tag: `<tr>`
- Table Header Cell Tag: `<th>`
- Table Data Cell Tag: `<td>`
- Form Tag: `<form>`
- Input Tags: `<input>` (various types), `<textarea>`, `<select>`, `<option>`, `<label>`, `<button>`

By the end of this project, you will be proficient in creating tables and forms, and you'll understand how to collect user input and process it.

## How to Use this Repository

This repository is organized into two main directories: `Event_Page_Project` and `Tables_Forms_Project`. Each directory contains a `starter` folder, which includes the initial code for the respective projects, and a `final` folder with the completed code.

To get started with a specific project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/html-project-tutorial.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project folder of your choice, either `Event_Page_Project` or `Tables_Forms_Project`.

3. Inside each project folder, you will find a `starter` and a `final` folder. Open the `starter` folder in your preferred code editor to access the initial code.

4. Follow along with the YouTube tutorial series to build the projects step-by-step. You can use the `starter` code as a starting point and make changes as guided in the tutorial.

5. If you encounter any issues or have questions during the tutorial, feel free to open an issue in this repository. We encourage collaboration and learning together!
