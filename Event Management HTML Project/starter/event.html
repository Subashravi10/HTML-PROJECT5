            A  Hacking Event is a competition in which ethical hackers compete for prestige and prizes by unearthing vulnerabilities in digital assets such as applications, devices and connected cars.
           These Bug Bounties typically last 1-2 days, involve dozens of participants, and can be held virtually or in person.
        Participants hack against the clock to find vulnerabilitiesand bug chains of the greatest possible severity,
          in pursuit of financial rewards and points that propel them up the leaderboard  and perhaps to a place on the final podium.
        Collaboration and the adrenalin of  competition inspire our finest hunters to even greater heights.
         Crucially, it’s also a chance for organisations to meet and learn from the world’s most accomplished security researchers. YesWeHack can advise you on the feasibility of a Live Hacking Event, 
         assist with planning events and help you handpick the right hunters for your scopes.
